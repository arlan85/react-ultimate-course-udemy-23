   * result opt 1:
   * So you saw that it basically reset our state. So very strange, very confusing probably. 
   * But again, it is actually for the exact same reason that earlier we heard the sound when we click here.
   * So the reason for that is once again, that whenever we click on that icon the allowSound state changes 
   * and so then the function is recreated. So then on that update, React sees a new function.
   * And since that function is here in the dependency array, it will run this effect again.
   * And so this effect will run with the current values of these four pieces of state. And so it will recalculate the duration based on that. Basically ignoring that earlier we had manually changed the duration with these buttons.
